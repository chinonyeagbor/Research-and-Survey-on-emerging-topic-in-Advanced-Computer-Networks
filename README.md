# A Survey on Load Balancing in Software-Defined Networking (SDN): An Emerging Topic in Advanced Computer Networks 
This project offers an in-depth survey of an emerging topic in Advanced Computer Networks, providing a detailed examination of the architecture, protocols, and foundational principles shaping future network technologies. 

Project Description:
This project provides a comprehensive survey on Load Balancing in Software-Defined Networking (SDN), a critical advancement in the field of computer networks. SDN represents a modern approach to network design, enabling centralized control and programmable network behavior by separating the control plane from the data plane. This survey specifically addresses load balancing techniques within SDN, a vital feature for ensuring optimal performance, scalability, and resilience across dynamic network environments.

As part of emerging trends in advanced computer networks, SDN’s load balancing capabilities are pivotal in managing network traffic efficiently, reducing latency, and avoiding resource bottlenecks. The research explores various load balancing algorithms, such as round-robin, least connections, and dynamic balancing, and evaluates their effectiveness in distributed SDN environments.

Learning Outcomes:

LO1: Gained an in-depth understanding of the architecture, protocols, and principles of SDN as an advanced network technology, with a focus on its load balancing mechanisms. By analyzing these aspects, the survey illuminates how SDN is reshaping traditional network management, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing flexibility.

LO2: Developed foundational knowledge of SDN’s core components, including SDN controllers, switches, and APIs, to understand how load balancing is practically implemented. This knowledge is essential for solving complex design challenges in distributed systems, spanning both physical and virtual network environments.

LO3: Conducted a critical analysis of the capabilities, limitations, and security implications of load balancing in SDN, particularly in the context of cybersecurity. SDN’s centralized nature offers unique security benefits, such as improved monitoring and response capabilities, but also presents vulnerabilities like targeted attacks on the SDN controller. This survey addresses security threats—such as DDoS attacks on network components—and highlights protective measures to secure SDN infrastructure.

LO4: Applied a suite of transferable skills useful for both industry and research, including analytical problem-solving, technical evaluation, and effective communication. These skills are essential for designing and managing secure, scalable network solutions that address both performance and security challenges in advanced computer networks.

Scope:
This survey is intended for those interested in the future of advanced computer networks, providing an overview of load balancing techniques in SDN and discussing their potential to create resilient, high-performance networks. It also underscores the importance of addressing cybersecurity in SDN environments, given the potential risks associated with centralized control. The research serves as a resource for understanding both the technical and security considerations in deploying SDN-based load balancing solutions effectively.
